and a refresh of the work done and projects by:

    - [cmarNYC](https://github.com/cmarNYC/Sims4Tools) - the first maintained fork.
    - [s4ptacle](https://github.com/s4ptacle/Sims4Tools) - the last maintained fork.
- ### [S4 CAS Tools](https://modthesims.info/d/582348/s4-cas-tools-updated-to-v3-5-3-1-on-9-11-2021.html) by cmarNYC.
- ### [s3pi](http://s3pi.sourceforge.net/) by Peter.

## Goal

Managing content for the Sims is hard. If using content from the gallery everything is done for you. When using content
from other creators it can become more challenging and difficult to figure out. Some of the challenges with managing
custom content include but is not limited to:

- Duplicate content.
- Multiple overrides.
- Load order of content.
- Game compatibility.
- Content updates.

In order to try and address this there are numerous tools that provide functionality that is often to complex or to
simple for what is required. After spending time trying to work through 5000+ custom content items the need for
something to automate or batch some of these functions became a must and Sims Toolkit was born.

Sims Toolkit is an attempt at trying to bring all this functionality into one place across both Windows and Mac.
