## Overview

Sims Toolkit is a updated set of tools to manage and maintain Sims 4 custom content files. It's built on .Net Core 6.0
and a refresh of the work done by various other projects and developers.

## Goal

Managing content for the Sims is hard. If using content from the gallery everything is done for you. When using content
from other creators it can become more challenging and difficult to figure out. Some of the challenges with managing
custom content include but is not limited to:

- Duplicate content.
- Multiple overrides.
- Load order of content.
- Game compatibility.
- Content updates.

To address these issues there are numerous tools providing functionality often to complex or to simple for what is
required. After spending time trying to work through 5000+ custom content items the need for something to automate or
batch some of these functions became a must and Sims Toolkit was born.

Sims Toolkit is an attempt at trying to bring all this functionality into one place across both Windows and Mac.

dealing with the internals of Sims `.package` files was taken from these projects.
